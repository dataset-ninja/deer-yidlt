**Deer (yidlt)** is a dataset for object detection tasks. It is used in the livestock industry.

The dataset consists of 1232 images with 1334 labeled objects belonging to 3 different classes including *Doe*, *Buck*, and *Human*.

Each image in the Deer (yidlt) dataset has bounding box annotations. There are 83 (7% of the total) unlabeled images (i.e. without annotations). There are 3 splits in the dataset: *test* (54 images), *valid* (105 images), and *train* (1073 images). The dataset was released in 2022 by the [Roboflow community](https://universe.roboflow.com/deertracker).
